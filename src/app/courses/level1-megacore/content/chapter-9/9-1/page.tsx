        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[#000000] mb-4">
          <li>Most exercises are fine to perform during the first trimester, however, the mother should be mindful of taking breaks to not overexert the body</li>
          <li>Neutral spine exercises are the best option</li>
          <li>Keep range of motion small to moderate</li>
          <li>Do not hold stretches and breath</li>
          <li>Minimize stretching the hamstring and inner thighs (adductor)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[#E43636] mt-4">Second Trimester (13 - 26 weeks) and Third Trimester (27 - 40 weeks)</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[#000000] mb-4">
          <li>No twisting or crunching ("torso twist should okay" and performed at the discretion of the mother) [have ready another exercise to substitute like a side plank or upper body exercises]</li>
          <li>Squatting exercises are a good exercise to prepare the pelvis for delivery</li>
          <li>No lifting of over 15 pounds</li>
          <li>Avoid laying on the back because it will decrease the supply of oxygen to the baby</li>
          <li>Do not allow the heart rate to pass 140 bpm</li>
          <li>It is recommended to utilize the stabilization pole</li>
          <li>2 white springs for 1 spring exercises is recommended (performing exercises on 1 white spring is at the discretion of the mother)</li>
          <li>5 white springs for heavy exercises is recommended rather than going too heavy (spring choice is at the discretion of the mother)</li>
          <li>Pelvic stability changes the most during week 20-27</li>
          <li>Take time when transitioning from exercise to exercise</li>
        </ul>

          <b>Note:</b> these are my own subjective opinions on what a pregnant client can and cannot perform during class through my own training and working with a Physical Therapist. We should always explain to pregnant clients that we are not doctors or healthcare professionals. We can refer clients to their primary care physician or OBGYN for further guidance with videos through YouTube or Instagram to show what Xformer Pilates is. This is important because most people do not know the difference between Pilates, Lagree, and Xformer Pilates.

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[#000000] mb-4">
          <li>Changes in rib cage placement elevates the diaphragm</li>
          <li>The respiratory rate / oxygen intake increases to supply both mother and baby</li>
          <li>Endurance and energy can lower due to the body working harder to supply adequate</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[#E43636] mt-4">Joints</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[#000000] mb-4">
          <li>The stability of joints and the action of muscles change</li>
          <li>The ligaments and cartilage soften and relax causing less stability in joints which can lead to an increase in injury</li>
          <li>The ligaments of the lower back and sacral area (S1 - S5) are greatly affected</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[#E43636] mt-4">Incontinence (the lack of voluntary control over urination and/or elimination)</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[#000000] mb-4">
          <li>The weight of the baby over time will increase pressure or stress on the bladder</li>
          <li>Strengthening the pelvic floor can reduce this risk</li>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[#000000] mb-4">
          <li>An increase in blood flow to the baby can increase core body temperature, which may cause feelings of dizziness and feeling light-headed</li>

        <h3 className="font-semibold text-[#E43636] mt-4">Balance and Postural Changes</h3>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-[#000000] mb-4">
          <li>The hip flexors will get short, sore, and tight from the weight of the stomach shifting the pelvis forward</li>
          <li>The center of gravity transfers upward and forward because of the weight increase of the front body</li>
          <li>The following can occur:</li>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-12 text-[#000000] mb-2">
            <li><b>Lumbar Lordosis:</b> An excessive arch in the lumbar portion of the back / spine</li>
