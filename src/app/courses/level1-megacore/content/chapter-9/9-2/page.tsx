        <p className="text-[#000000] mb-4">
          Please note: this routine is in my opinion "pregnancy friendly" based on working with clients who were pregnant at different stages of pregnancy and working with a Physical Therapist to confirm. I always recommend two white springs for any core stabilizers or light leg exercises at the front. Also, the stabilization pole should be close by. If balance is an issue for the pregnant client, have them perform floor lunges, well lunges, or squats on the floor. Pay attention to the pregnant client(s) during class and check in with them every now and then. Pregnant woman can be winded easier during pregnancy.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#000000] mb-4">
          An exercise at the front I'd advise against is the Carriage Lunge, however, there have been clients who still chose to perform it. At the end of the day, we do our best to have a conversation with pregnant clients to ensure their safety before class and it is their choice if they want to perform something we advise against.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#000000] mb-4">
          When a pregnant client is unable to perform an exercise, the go-to is always upper body exercises at the back platform or on the moving carriage. Have them on a reformer in the corner away from everyone to avoid distraction.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[#000000] mb-4">
          I've never come across a pregnant client that was absolutely new to Xformer during pregnancy. They've always prior experience. You can always ask management their opinion on the do's and don'ts
